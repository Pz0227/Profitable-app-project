# ðŸ“± Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets

This project explores the types of free mobile apps that are most likely to be profitable on the App Store and Google Play markets. As a data analyst, I analyzed real datasets from both platforms to guide app development decisions, particularly for apps monetized through in-app ads.

## ðŸ§  Objective

To identify app categories that are likely to attract large user bases and generate revenue through ads, with a focus on:

- Data cleaning and preparation
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Strategic insights and recommendations for developers

## ðŸ“Š Datasets Used

- [Google Play Store dataset (10,000 apps)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps)  
- [Apple App Store dataset (7,000 apps)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps)  

Both datasets were sampled from Kaggle and include key app details such as ratings, genre, price, install counts, and more.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Tasks

- Removed duplicate and irrelevant app entries
- Filtered datasets to focus on free, English-language apps
- Analyzed app categories, user ratings, and install trends
- Compared trends across Apple and Google Play markets

## ðŸ’¡ Key Insights

- **Games** dominate both platforms in number but not necessarily in profitability.
- **Productivity, Education, and Utility** apps tend to be more profitable due to focused audiences and fewer competitors.
- Free apps with engaging content and in-app ads are the most viable strategy.
